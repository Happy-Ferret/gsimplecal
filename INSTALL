INSTALLATION

First you need to install ``libunique`` and ``libunique-dev`` packages.
After that, just

cd gsimplecal
make
sudo make install

Instead of ``sudo make install`` you can copy gsimplecal binary
whereever you want.


UNINSTALLATION

If you used ``sudo make install``, to uninstall the software, run

cd gsimplecal
sudo make remove

Or you can simply delete ``/usr/bin/gsimplecal`` file.

Otherwise (if you copied the file manually) just delete the binary.
No files are created while running the programm.
