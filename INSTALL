INSTALLATION

First you need to install ``libunique`` and ``libunique-dev`` packages.
You will need gtk2 packages (and their -dev version, if they are
separated in your distro), g++ compiler and pkg-config. Use your package
manager to install those you are missing too.

After that, just

$ cd gsimplecal
$ make
$ sudo make install

Instead of ``sudo make install`` you can copy gsimplecal binary
whereever you want (somewhere in your $PATH, I guess).


UNINSTALLATION

If you used ``sudo make install``, to uninstall the software, run

$ cd gsimplecal
$ sudo make remove

Or you can simply delete ``/usr/bin/gsimplecal`` file.

Otherwise (if you copied the file manually), just delete the binary.

No additional files are created while using the program.
