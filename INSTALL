INSTALLATION

First you need to install ``libunique`` and ``libunique-dev`` packages.
You will need gtk2 packages (and their -dev version, if they are
separated in your distro), g++ compiler and pkg-config. Use your package
manager to install those you are missing too.

After that, just

$ cd gsimplecal
$ make
$ sudo make install

This will copy compiled binary into /usr/local/bin folder.

Instead of ``sudo make install`` you can copy gsimplecal binary
whereever you want (somewhere in your $PATH, I guess).

Also you can use PREFIX variable to change the install destination:

$ sudo su
# PREFIX=/usr make install
# logout


UNINSTALLATION

If you used ``sudo make install``, to uninstall the software, run

$ cd gsimplecal
$ sudo make remove

If you used custom prefix, use it here too.

Alternatively, you can simply delete gsimplecal binary file.

No additional files are created while using the program.
