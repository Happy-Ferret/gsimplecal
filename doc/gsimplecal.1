.SH NAME
gsimplecal \- lightweight calendar applet

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gsimplecal

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the usage of the
.B gsimplecal
command.

.PP
.B gsimplecal
is a lightweight calendar applet. When it is started, it first shows up, when
you run it again, it closes the running instance. It was intentionally made for
use with tint2 panel to be launched upon clock click, but of course it will
work without it, you can bind it to some hotkey in you window manager, for
example.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
You may configure gsimplecal to display different world timezones clocks.
To make it, you should create
.nh
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gsimplecal/config\fP
.ny
file (usually it will be
.nh
~/.config/gsimplecal/config
.ny
) with the following contents:

.IP
show_calendar = 1
.br
show_timezones = 1
.br
clock_format = %a %d %b %H:%M
.br
clock_label = UTC
.br
clock_tz = :UTC
.br
clock_label = Local
.br
clock_tz = 

.PP
The options are pretty self explanatory, I guess. You can see
the wiki page at http://code.google.com/p/gsimplecal/wiki/Configuration for more
detailed description.
.PP
\fBNOTE\fP: The clock_label and clock_tz options must be in this order and go in
pairs.
.PP
Also, if you omit the value for clock_tz option, local time will be used.
.PP
For a list of timezones see man timezone.
.PP
For possible clock formats see man strftime.

This manual page was written by the same person, that's why it isn't any of a
help, programmers hate writing docs. Hopefullly, noone will ever see this man page.
